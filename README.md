# Sentiment-chatbot

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis Chatbot! This project harnesses the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and pre-trained models to create an interactive chatbot that can understand and respond to users' emotional states. The chatbot analyzes the sentiment of user inputs and provides appropriate responses based on the detected sentiment.

Features
Sentiment Detection: Uses a pre-trained model to analyze the sentiment of user inputs (positive, negative, or neutral).
Adaptive Responses: The chatbot adjusts its responses based on the detected sentiment to provide empathetic and relevant replies.
Interactive Interface: Engaging and user-friendly interaction model to facilitate seamless communication.
Easily Extendable: The chatbot's response logic can be easily extended to handle more complex scenarios and emotions.
Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used to build the chatbot.
Transformers: Hugging Face's library for using pre-trained models for sentiment analysis.
NLP: Natural Language Processing techniques to understand and analyze user inputs.
How It Works
Sentiment Analysis: Utilizes a pre-trained model from Hugging Face to analyze the sentiment of user inputs.
Response Generation: Based on the detected sentiment, the chatbot generates an appropriate response to engage with the user.
User Interaction: Users can have a conversation with the chatbot, and it will respond according to the emotional tone of their messages.
